Technologies Used:

Unity 3D: The primary development platform for creating the AR/VR experience.
C#: The programming language used for scripting within Unity.
XML and KML: XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and KML (Keyhole Markup Language) are used for data representation and structuring, especially for location-based information and map data. KML is an XML format often used for geospatial data.
APIs Integrated:

Mapbox API: Mapbox is a mapping and location data platform. We use the Mapbox API to provide accurate mapping and navigation services within the app. It offers features like geocoding, real-time location data, and customization of map styles.
